A timer specifies the **threshold** *after which* a provided callback *may be executed* rather than the **exact** time a person *wants it to be executed*. Timers callbacks will run as early as they can be scheduled after the specified amount of time has passed; however, Operating System scheduling or the running of other callbacks may delay them.
